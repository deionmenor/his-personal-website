Facebook Inc. has announced plans earlier this week that they would soon rebrand under a new name. The rebranding effort was said to align with their company's future ambitions: an inter-connected _**metaverse**_.

### **What is the Metaverse?**

Coined in Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash in the early 90s, the concept of a metaverse pointed at the future of the internet. In the novel, people create their own avatars in a shared 3D virtual space which has now become the main way people interact with each other.

The concept is now ingrained in pop culture, particularly with movies such as _The Matrix_ and _Tron_. With the internet bringing the world together at an unprecedented scale, people started to wonder if they could escape the real worldâ€”**if they could build their own**.

### **Why now?**

Games like _Roblox_ and _Minecraft_ show us a hint at virtual platforms where users can build anything that they can imagine. MMOs such as _World of Warcraft_ gave us a glimpse of how a virtual economy might work.

With the rise of VR technologies, including Facebook's own _Oculus_, the promise of an immersive experience is becoming closer to a reality. Digital economies are now enabled by blockchain technology, where assets can be bought and traded at scale. The global pandemic has become a litmus test in the effectiveness of virtual spaces, with performers like Travis Scott and Lil Nas X performing virtual concerts and the esports industry being valued at over a billion dollars this year.

### **Should we be alarmed?**

Facebook has been under a lot of criticism lately, with the way they deal with user data, and their anti-competitive practices. Facebook launching a metaverse will only serve to **increase their influence**, in a world where so many third-world nations see Facebook as "The Internet".

The recent Facebook outage had billions of people unable to access Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook for over six hours. It highlights the potential issues of a **centralized** form of communication, commerce, and culture.

As it stands, Facebook is making a big bet on the metaverse. Like how people decades ago marveled at the idea of video conferencing, photorealistic video games, and a pocket-sized supercomputer, we may soon be facing another breakthrough in the way tech tries to emulate, or perhaps **replace**, the real world.
