I've recently enjoyed reading Nadia Eghbal's [blog post](https://nadiaeghbal.com/creator-economy) on the creator economy. She challenges the idea of participating in this growing economy, or at least invites us to look deeper into the motivations behind it. As a researcher, she differentiates the difference between "research" and "reading books all day". "If you’re reading books to try to understand something that no one else understands yet, that’s research." The former is purposeful, while the latter is entertainment. Reading for the sake of it is not inherently bad, but if everyone read books for fun there would not be any advancements in academia.

She ponders the nature of creating. Is being a creator similar to research or is it more like entertainment? The original premise of the creator economy was allowing individuals to earn a living doing what they love. But the nature of being a creator may simply boil down to the act of creating itself. Will a creator--for the sake of keeping the label of creator-- be obligated to write every day, even if what they create has little meaning to them?

Lately I've dived deep into the space, and continue to be inspired by people who create a living out of content creation. The Internet has provided an amazing opportunity for people to earn social capital (followers, mentions, connections) even if they lack actual capital. I've only started on this journey, navigating what's best for me. But when I reach the point of making a decent living out of my work, what then becomes the point to continue? I feel like any creator out there should find some higher calling to their work, beyond any monetary gain to come out of it.

I am reminded of the famous Youtuber Mr. Beast. He's garnered a good 75M followers on Youtube, and he definitely earns a lot of money from his regular content. But behind the flashy antics of videos such as "Press This Button to Win $100,000" and "Would You Rather Have a Lamborghini or This House", there is a point to it all. A portion of the revenue from his viral videos goes to food banks and environmental advocacy groups, which I think is high up there in the list of things that you can do to make a positive impact on the world.

I feel like a creator can fulfill both roles--that his work can both provide entertainment and a positive impact in the world. And that's something I'll have to think about.
