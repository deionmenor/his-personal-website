**The Midnight Library is a feel-good book about a woman who finds an opportunity to traverse alternate realities to find her perfect life. It may not dive as deep into the concept as I'd like, but it was definitely a fun and easy read.**

The story revolves around a thirty-something woman named Nora who works in a music store in the town she grew up in. She's not really happy about her life, and she often laments about what could have been. She remembers the passions she loved and abandoned growing up: from swimming to music to exploring the Arctic Ocean to fight climate change. She thinks of what could have happened if she stayed with her ex, or followed her best friend to Australia. One day, she decides to take her own life. But she wakes up in this ethereal library. Each book, the mysterious librarian states, takes her to an alternate version of her life. Throughout the novel she explores those realities, and soon discover her thoughts about her own life. If she ends up finding the perfect life, the librarian says, she will eventually forget all about the midnight library and basically live the life she chose.

It's a high concept premise. It reminds me of a previous book I read, Everyday by David Levithan, which explores waking up everyday in a life much different from your own.

The concept hooks you, and it helps that each chapter is quite short. It takes about 2-3 minutes to read each one. Every new life Nora explores exposes the reader to new settings and characters, but our protagonist is largely inactive. Each new vignette would confront her with a life that seemed great on paper, but the fact that she literally knows nothing about the new life she lived in always makes it a bit of a chore to see her clueless every few chapters. Luckily, enough information is available to her to get the gist of things, conveniently with text messages and random knick-knacks and stuff decorated around whatever room she jumped into.

The concept could have definitely been explored more. I think it was all too convenient that every time she tried to go to a new reality it was spelled out how successful she was. Outside of the very last reality, each new world read like an unrealistic success story almost out of a Forbes Most Powerful Women list. Since it was established that there were an infinite number of realities, it makes sense, but it makes most of the realities seem same-y. Most of the issues revolved around family, relationships, and career decisions. It would have been more interesting to see very out-there what-if scenarios that wasn't afraid to tackle some darker, more adult themes. But hey, it's a feel good book for a reason!

In the end, the book is a celebration of life, and an exploration of the way we handle our regrets. Though it didn't blow me away with its characterization or dialogue, it intrigued me with the burning question: what if? That question was both in Nora's head as it was in mine, and it kept me wanting to read till the end. Halfway through the book, I had an idea already on how the story should (logically) end, but it didn't stop me from enjoying Nora's journey through different worlds, different possibilities.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Favorite Quote:** "_But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy."_
