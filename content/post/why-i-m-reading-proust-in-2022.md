Though I do call myself a book lover, I've never been a *quick* reader. I always feel like I could be reading more. 

Which is why I felt uniquely drawn to the challenge of reading the world's longest novel, Marcel Proust's *In Search of Lost Time* (1913). 

Heralded as one of the greatest works of fiction of the 20th century, it follows a narrator's recollection of his childhood, while reflecting on the loss of time one encounters in life. Not the most exciting plot, but Proust excels in his vivid descriptions of his memories and the world around him.

Here are **3** things I hope to find in my journey through Proust's magnum opus.

##### ‚è≤Ô∏èPatience
Many readers of Proust recommend reading his work a few pages at a time. Given that copies of this novel stretch between 3,000 to 4,000 pages, it might take months for me to reach the end. I'm in it for the long haul. 

##### ‚úçÔ∏è Interaction
I intend to take down a lot of notes. I'll highlight my favorite passages. Look up the works of art Proust mentions in passing. Perhaps a book gives back the amount of effort you put in. 

##### üåè Perspective
I've read up a bit on Marcel's struggles as a writer, and I can find a bit of myself in him. The text may be over a hundred years old, but so many of life's tribulations are timeless. The pandemic has taken away much of my sense of time, I'm hoping this novel will help me regain it somehow.

 

P.S.

My copy of *Lost Time* resides in an old iPad mini I got from my mother. It's a dying breed, a first-generation model. Though a victim of planned obsolescence, it has regained new life as my e-book reader.
