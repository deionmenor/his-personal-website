# The Season of Focus

Most people try to start resolutions with a very specific goal in mind. A common one would be the resolution many people have at the beginning of the year to workout or hit the gym. Statistics show that a large majority of people quit their gym membership after a couple months. Though reasons for this may vary from person to person, it's likely that the difficulty of keeping up with resolutions, especially those who set them to high, leads to quitting sooner.

It seems that goal-setting is tricky for a lot of people, including me. But this month, I'll be trying something new which I hope will push me to reach my goals more effectively.

## The Theme System

Inspired by CGP Grey's [Theme System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), I've decided to join in with my own theme this month.

The Theme System, as described by CGP Grey, is a way for you to easily help make decisions and reach your goals in a way that is also more flexible and manageable on a daily basis. Instead of setting resolutions, we should be coming up with THEMES. The theme will guide your decisions in daily life.

## Choosing My Theme

For some, a year might be too long of a commitment, so I've decided to start with a "season" instead, which should be about three months. 

I've considered the following as possible keywords for my season:
- Habit
- Control
- Focus
- Curiosity
- Self-Improvement
- Wellness
- Mindfulness

After some thought, I've decided on the word FOCUS. A good theme should be broad enough that it'll apply to multiple aspects of your life, both personal and professional. With the theme of FOCUS in mind, it'll help me out with some of the goals I wrote down beforehand
- staying fit/working out consistently
- working on interesting side projects
- work on my writing

My season of FOCUS will also discourage me from doing things that will keep me out of focus such as:
- too much social media
- trying to work on too many things at once
- losing sleep
	
The last one in particular has been an issue I've been working on improving for years. I've always wanted to just wake up one day as a morning person, but alas, my phone and monkey brain had other things in mind. Hopefully with this season of FOCUS now under way, I'll get to go to bed sooner and actually focus on getting a good night's rest. 

## Positive Feedback Loop
In the same way that the mind continually makes excuses to not do something, I believe that with the right mindset, the mind will find ways to encourage you to keep on doing something. I've experienced this first hand living with a Theme in mind.

For example, every time I feel the urge to use social media, my theme slips in and tells me that I could use that spare 30 minutes to an hour doing something that aligns with FOCUS, such as writing or working on a side project. 

I've become more mindful of my workload as well, making sure that I don't jump from one task to another and end up feeling fatigued. Having a theme is a positive feedback loop since the more you work into aligning your actions with your theme, the stronger the motivation is to keep it up in the first place. Similar to the ["Don't Break the Chain"](https://blog.doist.com/dont-break-the-chain/) technique, once you start being consistent at something, it becomes much more appealing to keep the "streak" even if you don't feel like following your theme at the present.

## What's Next

To keep the momentum going, I'll be documenting my experience during my Season of Focus here in my blog. I hope the rise in productivity and output should speak for itself in the coming weeks. Also, if you're reeading this, I'm inviting you to try this out for yourself. I've already asked a friend of mine to join me as well in my Season of Focus and we've become even more motivated since we now both need to keep the other accountable.
