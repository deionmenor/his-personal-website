Many readers have probably heard of the term *tsundoku*. This Japanese slang refers to the collection of reading materials which are never read. The word combines elements of tsunde-oku (積んでおく, to pile things up ready for later and leave) and dokusho (読書, reading books). It often comes up in those lists of foreign vocabulary that are deemed untranslateable to English. 

It's a word I've grown fond with, it having become a more and more veracious description of my bookshelf as the years go by. As a recent example, I've bought a dozen books earlier this year at the Big Bad Wolf Book Fair (before the lockdown), but ten months later and I've only opened two of them, and have finished none.

This habit of acquiring things and never reading them does not limit itself to the domain of literature however. Those who use Steam may lament at their video game "backlog", games they've purchased on a whim in seasonal sales which will now forever collect binary dust on their digital library. People who like to buy clothes or accessories sometimes wear things once and never again. 

But I feel I'm most guilty with a sort of hyperlink hoarding: collecting articles, Youtube videos, Reddit threads, Github repos, research papers that have caught my attention. I even have a growing list of bookmarked Amazon product pages for books I'd like to read someday, which is inarguably its own form of abstracted digital tsundoku.

The web seems to encourage this type of "read-it-later" behavior, with websites like Pocket allowing you to store link after link in a reading list for later consumption. I've used Pocket for years, but it's become another tsundoku for me, with hundreds of links I've saved that I haven't gotten around to checking out. 

Youtube also encourages video tsundokus with their "Watch Later" functionality built right into the app itself. However, unlike my Pocket list, this feature gets a bit more use out of me. Maybe the friction of opening Pocket is a bit greater than checking out my Youtube backlog, since I open Youtube daily anyway. But even so, my app tells me I have 558 unwatched videos lying around, waiting for me.

Seems like technology has made it easier than ever to collect things you will never read. Can you imagine someone thirty years ago taking the time to cut out and store every newspaper articles or magazine feature story, every time they encounter something they might feel like reading later? But then again, the term tsundoku dates back to the Meiji era, which ended in 1912. And in 1921, A. Edward Newton, an avid book collector, wrote the following: "Even when reading is impossible, the presence of books acquired produces such an ecstasy that the buying of more books than one can read is nothing less than the soul reaching towards infinity… **we cherish books even if unread, their mere presence exudes comfort, their ready access reassurance.**”

I've had some spare time this December to sift through my Pocket reading list, my Youtube Watch Later playlist, my saved Reddit and Twitter threads, and the hundreds of links between them. I've asked myself, "Do these links excude comfort or reassurance?"

I'm not so sure myself.
