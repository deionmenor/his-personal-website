This is really quite exciting.

This is my first blog post using the Hugo framework. It's ridiculously easy to set up a site with it.

Yesterday, to spur me to keep going with this personal website idea, I went and purchased the domain you are probably reading this from right now. I'm still not sure what I'll be writing here, but I'll have a lot of time considerin the quarantine and all.

Here's to continuous improvement and learning.
