My first encounter with the idea of a strange loop was in a very thick book.

Douglas Hofstadter's 1977 work Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid was a book that I had my eye on for a while. I've heard from articles and internet discussion boards that G.E.B ( as it is commonly referred to ) was quite the “intellectual” book, covering a span of topics including consciousness, mathematics, art, and philosophy among others. The only copies I could find online PDFs with badly-scanned, oversaturated, grainy pages. This prompted me to wait until I either come across a better file, or an actual copy in a bookstore. A couple days after Christmas, my mother gave me P2000 to buy whatever book I want in booklovers’ heaven, commonly known as the Fully Booked Branch at Bonifacio High Street. It was there that I finally came across G.E.B. in the form it was meant to be read.

I was soon daunted by the complexity of the book. There were far too many footnotes and block quotes per page than I was ever used to. The author really took his time to set up his analogies. I struggled to understand how Bach's music related to the nature of consciousness, or how Escher's paintings were a gateway to revealing the secrets of intelligence and the self. Throw in the “philosophy of mathematics” and I very quickly realized that days have passed and I haven't really absorbed much from the page. Hofstadter kept mentioning how he's building up to this idea of strange loops, but it took too long to get to the main idea. Feeling defeated, I placed the heavy tome back in my shelf.

A year later, I came across an article criticizing Hofstadter's book.  I found good company in the comments section of the article, as I saw that many others also found GEB to be a bit hard to parse. It was then that I saw several readers suggesting an another book by Hofstadter that would satisfy the itch that GEB could not scratch. This book was titled I Am A Strange Loop and was published almost 30 years after GEB. Readers described it as a more accessible ( and thankfully shorter!) book on the main thesis of his 1979 book. This will be my reflection on that book.

I Am A Strange Loop is set up with the claim that the reason why consciousness can arise from what pretty much just molecules and atoms is that there are special ways for a system of meaningless objects to eventually grow complex and flexible enough to allow self-reference. This involves what Hofstadter refers to as a Strange Loop. A strange loop is paradoxical in nature, something like arguing whether the chicken or the egg came first. A strange loop is going up a ladder and reaching the top, only to find yourself right where you started. It is this strange loopiness that seems to give rise to consciousness. How so?

Hofstadter argues that the human mind is constantly creating symbols or ideas which are based on its surrounding world. This behavior can be seen very minutely in a fly, perhaps more so in a fish, and definitely found in my household pet dog, Chewie. My dog has some idea of who I am, what food is, the layout of my house, and other things relevant to dogs. Unlike Chewie however, I my mind is able to create a pattern, a mental model of my place in the world. This gives rise to the feeling of an “I”. Being able to do this is essentially the key to cognition, according to Hofstadter.

Hofstadter uses many analogies in his book to explain the mysterious gap between the physics and chemistry of the brain and the emotions and ideas that lie in the level of consciousness that we experience. The most memorable one in my opinion would be his analogy of the brain to a musical composition. Take for example the humble B note. On its own it has no inherent meaning, but when combined with other kinds of notes and strategically placed in a timeline, we may get to experience the work of Mozart, The Rolling Stones, or even Drake. Similarly, each neuron in the brain would be meaningless by itself. However, put all together, we are then capable of complex thought, ideas, and emotions.

Now that I read the main ideas of I Am A Strange Loop, how did these ideas personally affect me? Well, while reading this book, I've started to become more introspective on the nature of my own consciousness. The questions posed in many of the chapters in I Am A Strange Loop make me sometimes feel a sense of dread. What happens to my consciousness after I die? Could I really call this “self” an illusion? Is there room for a spiritual belief of the soul in the systems that Hofstadter describes? These are questions I continue to grapple with.

One of the most profound and beautiful ideas I got from this book was the idea of living past your own death. In Hofstadter's view, the mind is simply a collection of patterns and feedback loops. However, he also states that the more we get to know someone, the more we get to understand the inner workings of their mind. And with that, those patterns that make up my own consciousness, live on in the minds of others. I find it comforting to think that long after someone dies, the part of their mind that loves their family, or remembers the fun times they had with their friends, live on in those who knew that person. It's a thought that even my usually skeptical self can accept as true, for now at least.

The ideas in this book also make me deeply appreciative of life on Earth. Billions of years had made single-celled organisms, which are simply driven by the need to multiply and obtain energy ( in order to multiply), into humans who can write sonnets, build rocket ships, and even question the nature of its own consciousness. It is commonly known that the Church preaches that life is a gift, but both philosophy and science seem to reinforce that sentiment as well.

Through the use of creative analogies and anecdotes, I had a clear picture of the arguments he was trying to present. I was surprisingly intrigued by his chapters on the philosophical aspects of mathematics, a topic which I could barely grasp in his previous book. Perhaps I can try reading GEB again with more confidence.

Hofstadter's book has shown me a glimpse at the beauty of existence. And because I myself am a strange loop, I can begin to ask myself a surprisingly paradoxical question: Has not the beauty of consciousness just given itself the ability to appreciate its own beauty? I am a strange loop indeed.
