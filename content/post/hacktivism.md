## The Open Access Movement

In the 11th of January 2013, Aaron Hillel Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment , with a belt looped around his neck. He was an American computer programmer and entrepreneur, who spent much of his recent life being a sort of “hacktivist”. He was a man of many interests. He was a co-founder of Reddit, participated in the Creative Commons organization and had a hand in preventing the notorious Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA. His advocacy was for open access, a world where all the world's research were to be released free of cost, without any barriers. 

His death came amidst a long legal battle against the state. Swartz spent a few weeks in late 2010 and early 2011 downloading millions of documents from the MIT network, of which he had access to as a research fellow. Swartz's main source of documents was JSTOR, a digital repository of academic journals. In September of 2012, he was indicted for 13 federal crimes and $1 million in fines. He refused to plead guilty to these crimes, opting instead for a trial. It is unknown why he committed suicide, having left no note, but it is clear that this prosecution was surely a pressing issue for him in the months leading up to his death.
Swartz believed in the right to access information. In his Guerilla Open Access Manifesto, he wrote:

> “Information is power. The world's entire scientific [...] heritage […] is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations […]. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it.”

What makes this movement so important for our current times? We live in a world where knowledge is instantaneously transferrable from one device to another, at virtually no cost at all. It is important for everyone to have access to research, because it gives people the power to make more informative choices and multiplies the impact the research could possibly have in the world. The relation between power and knowledge is central in this issue. Michel Foucault's conception of power will help us understand the impact knowledge can have in society.

## Power-Knowledge Relations

Before Foucault, power was originally divided into three faces. Robert Dahl described the first face of power as coercion, where "A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do." Bachrach and Baratz’ concept of a Second Face of power argue that power can also be deciding which issues to pay attention to, a form of agenda setting. Steven Lukes proposed a third face of power, which concerns itself with the power of ideologies, which allow subjects to be manipulated into wanting to do what people in power desire. These three definitions of power are similar in the sense that power is contained within an individual A in order to influence an individual B's actions. This traditional definition of power is visible and easy to identify. 

Foucault provides an alternate definition of power, wherein power does not simply consider individuals, but also considers the social constructions we live in. For Foucault, power is never in anybody's hands. Power exists insofar as it is manifested in the interactions we have with society every day. Thus power lies in every social practice, and therefore cannot be escaped. Foucauldian power, unlike the other three faces, are not defined in opposition to freedom. After all, it is impossible to extract yourself from social interaction or the societal structures that one is born to in this world.

The fourth face of power can be regarded as a normative form of power. It constructs the way we view society and ourselves, and is the root cause of all our desires and actions. The liberal notions of power tell us that a commander, because of his position and manner of action, has power over his troops. Yet under a Foucaldian notion of power, both the commander and his troops are subject to a power that makes them act as a commander and a soldier should act, which is a power that lies not in any one individual, but exists in a collective societal construct that had been built up through a long history of choices, which Foucault calls a geneology. 

Foucault notes a very distinct relationship between knowledge and power. He says that "..power and knowledge directly imply one another," and gives us the following two statements:  that (1) there can not be power relations without a certain field of knowledge, and that (2) knowledge itself presupposes a certain power relation. The first statement indicates that in order for Foucaldian power to function, there must already exist an existing body of truth for which this power can be guided towards. Our norms will be directed towards what is held as true, what goes against our agreed upon truths is considered deviant. 

The second statement goes even further and says that ultimately, no truth can escape power. Digeser speculates that Foucault is indicating that no matter how a certain truth is guaranteed to be true, we can always question what guarantees that guarantee. This would lead to an infinite line of questioning, which may indicate that knowledge can never guarantee itself, thus there must be power to ground all forms of knowledge. Power exists in societal structures that guide the pursuit and delivery of knowledge. These include people in the academia, book publishers, journal editors, and even students in universities. Without power, there would be no sense of science at all. It is only through an exercise of power do we come to accept things as "facts." These two statements, taken together, brings us to the conclusion that power both produces and is produced by knowledge. 

## Foucaldian power and scientific research

With the rise of the internet, information is being produced, published, and shared at an exponential rate. And with this growth comes the responsibility to keep entities from controlling the spread of information. Foucault's power-knowledge relationship highlights an important issue of today's political climate. Politics and facts are inseparable. Scientific research acts as a source for the truths to which government policies must be based upon. 

What we know about climate change drastly affects our political and economical policies. What we know about the demographics of our nation informs our decisions on whether to pass certain laws and repeal others. In a Foucauldian perspective, research shapes the way society decides what is normal. To take a recent example, medical research completely refutes the anti-vaccination movement, showing that there is indeed no link between vaccines and autism. These studies set a precedent of what should be considered the norm. Those who support the anti-vax movement are seen as deviants by the rest of society, and are totalized as being ignorant or naive. Similarly, power is necessary for knowledge to be produced because it is Foucauldian power that shapes the identity of the would-be academics, the would-be writers, and the would-be activists of the world that aim to keep knowledge open and free for all. As power is prevalent in all social intitutions, academic institutions such as the university is not exempt from the influence of Foucauldian power. 

Stewart Brand, a writer who argued for the liberating potential of technology, said that  information wants to be expensive, but at the same time also wants to be free. Knowledge is becoming increasingly valuable but also becomes cheaper and easier to disseminate through technology. This paradox lends itself to much debate and it is likely that the tension between these two directions may never go away, which is why we must continue re-negotiating the rights we have regarding our access to information, because as we have shown, the power of information is absolutely indispensible.

>This  essay was inspired by a recent book I read, The Idealist: Aaron Swartz and the Rise of Free Culture on the Internet, which focuses on the history of copyright in the United States and a primer on the open access movement, all framed around and culminating to the tragic death of hacktivist and entrepreneur Aaron Swartz. As a computer scientist myself, I found his story equally riveting and inspiring, reminding me once more that we live in the age of both boundless information and open free speech, both of which must be protected at all costs.
