# Quantifying my Screen Time

We all spend a lot of time on our phones. I think we can all agree with that. The isntant gratification we get from everything being a click away has made it kind of addicting. I think we all know this to be true, but I wanted a number. How much time every day or every week gets poured into all these different applications.

Using an app called Action Dash, I was able to get a clearer picture on where my time goes. It shows me a total number of minutes spent daily, but you can also further break it down by app, or even by hour. 

After seeing that I spend about 22-24 hours each week on my phone, it became much more pressing to me. A whole day of my week on the phone? I tried rationalizing it a bit, considering all the times I need to use my phone to talk to friends and family, or to order food, shop for groceries in this never ending pandemic, so I tried excluding those apps from the total count. Surprisingly, even then, I had about 18 hours of usage a day. 

Yesterday, I tried to limit my usage to 90 minutes? Why 90 minutes? Well its the standard length of an average film, and I thought if I framed it as "Would you sit down and stare at 90mins of something on a tiny screen", I would obviously lean towards no. If I can't fathom 90, how could I possibly live with 6-7 hours a day. I ended up whittling it down over the week to a manageable 1hr and 13 mins.

It of course takes some time to develop a habit, and I'll jsut wait and see if the additional 5-6 hrs lead to time well spent, and of course we'll see if it'll help with my goals in this season of focus.

P.S. The app, though a useful metric, doesn't quite capture everything. The time I spend on my laptop or on my Smart TV doesn't reflect here, and I'll have to think of a way in the future to check that out as well.
